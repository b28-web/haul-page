# Project Overview — Active Status Board

> **All agents: update this file when you complete a ticket, surface a blocker, or learn something that affects other work.** This is the central information board. The developer reads this to understand what's happening without checking every ticket.

## Current state

**Phase:** Foundation (S-001) complete. Landing page (S-002) complete. Accounts domain (S-004) complete. Scan page (S-005) complete. Booking form (S-003) nearly complete — 3/4 done. Content domain (S-006) in progress — 1/5 done, T-006-01 implementing.

**What works:** Dev server healthy on port 4000. 86 tests passing. Ash resources live: Accounts domain (Company, User, Token with tenant provisioning), Operations domain (Job with state machine), Content domain (SiteConfig, Service, GalleryItem, Endorsement, Page). Landing page at `/` with dark grayscale theme + print stylesheet. Scan page LiveView at `/scan` with gallery. Booking LiveView at `/book`. QR code generation. CI pipeline. Dockerfile. Fly deploy configured.

**What's next:** T-001-06 (mix-setup) done — service integration stories are unblocked:
- **Content chain:** T-006-01 (content-resources) implementing → T-006-02 → T-006-03 → T-006-04
- **Booking finish:** T-003-03 (photo-upload) in research → T-003-04 (browser-qa)
- **Service integrations now unblocked:** T-007-01/02 (swoosh/SMS), T-008-01 (stripe), T-009-01 (places proxy)

## Blockers & risks

- **All completed work is uncommitted** — 16 tickets worth of code in working tree, nothing committed since `12e40ee`. Serious data-loss risk.
- **Dockerfile image size** — 278MB vs 100MB target. Ash ecosystem is the cause. Acceptable for now.

## Decisions made during implementation

- **No LiveView for landing page** — server-rendered via PageController, not LiveView.
- **Operator config via `config.exs`** — business name, phone, email, services list hardcoded as defaults, overridable at runtime via env vars.
- **Haul.Cldr module added** — required by ex_money/ash_money. Not in original spec.
- **daisyUI themes disabled, custom grayscale themes defined** — dark/light via `[data-theme]` attribute + localStorage toggle.
- **Print layout: tear-off coupon strip** — 8 vertical coupons with phone number.
- **Scan page uses LiveView** — ScanLive for dynamic gallery content.
- **Booking uses LiveView** — BookingLive with real-time validation, creates Job in :lead state.
- **Content domain resources defined** — SiteConfig, Service, GalleryItem, Endorsement, Page with Ash resources and Content.Loader.

## Cross-ticket notes

- **Ash resources now live** — Accounts (Company, User, Token), Operations (Job), Content (SiteConfig, Service, GalleryItem, Endorsement, Page). Schema-per-tenant via AshPostgres :context strategy.
- **Test count: 86** — substantial test coverage across accounts, operations, content, controllers.
- **Browser QA tickets completed:** T-002-04 (landing page), T-005-04 (scan page) — both passed.
- **Remaining browser QA:** T-003-04 (booking), T-006-05 (content pages), T-007-05 (notifications), T-008-04 (payments), T-009-03 (address autocomplete).
